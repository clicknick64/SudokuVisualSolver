# Sudoku Visual Solver

This is the first version and it's not polished. However you can run the app with
```
python3 app.py
```
Press enter to solve a hard coded sudoku or insert a sudoku in this form:
```
Enter sudoku: 003020600900305001001806400008102900700000008006708200002609500800203009005010300
```

The solving process is slow intentionally to showcase the algorithm.
